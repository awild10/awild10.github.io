                    <h2>What are your prices?</h2>
                    <p>$35 for a half hour, $52.50 for 45 minutes, $70 for an hour.</p>
                   
                    <h2>Where do lessons take place?</h2>
                    <p>I offer both in-home and online video lessons. Learn in the comfort of your own home!</p>

                    <h2>What do you teach?</h2>
                    <p>I teach well rounded music lessons for all levels of guitar and beginner through intermediate levels for piano and ukulele. I also teach skills like composition, improvisation and music theory, either as a regular part of instrumental lessons, or as standalone instruction.</p>

                    <h2>Can you teach ____ style/genre?</h2>
                    <p>Generally yes, however if you're an experienced intermediate or advanced student there may be certain styles I won't be a good fit for, depending on your goals. If this is you, please communicate what you're looking for through the contact form and I'll see if we're a good fit! I'm most knowledgeable and experienced teaching rock, pop, classical and music from media (video games, movies etc).</p>

                    <h2>What is your cancellation policy?</h2>
                    <p>I need 24 hour notice for any cancellations! For withdrawals from lessons I need a weeks’ notice. The notice for withdrawals doesn’t apply for the first 4 lessons.</p>

                    <h2>How does billing work?</h2>
                    <p>Billing is all through Square! You receive an email or text and pay with a card.</p>

                    <h2>Do you teach from a book? Will we read music?</h2>
                    <p>I do, but both are totally optional based on your preferences! My recommended approach is using a method book for consistent linear progress, while also working together to fill out your ‘song wishlist’ and learn those songs as you’re ready.</p>
